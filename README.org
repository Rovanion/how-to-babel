* Hi there!

Welcome to this tutorial on Emacs and how to use org-mode as a
literate programming or systems administration environment.

** Bootstrapping

You will need Emacs. But I also want to show you the package manager
Guix, so I will have you get Emacs through Guix. Run the following
commands in a shell.

#+begin_src sh
wget https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/guix.git/plain/etc/guix-install.sh
chmod +x guix-install.sh
./guix-install.sh
#+end_src

** Installing Emacs

Then we start an environment with Emacs and org-mode in it.

#+begin_src sh
guix environment --ad-hoc emacs emacs-org
#+end_src

This will spawn you a new shell with ~emacs~ and ~emacs-org~ installed.

** To infinity, and beyond

With that done, you can now either follow along in the file
